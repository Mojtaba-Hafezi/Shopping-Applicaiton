This is an Asp.Net Core MVC application for managing the sales in a store. For the connection string in "appsettings.json" file i used a connection string that works with local database. So make sure local db is installed on your machine. Then in PMC (package manager console) apply database-update to apply the migrations and seeding the initial data in database.
After running the app in Categories and Products tabs you can see, edit or delete categories and products as the manager.
In sell tab you can sell the products as the chashier. The name of the cashier is by default Cashier1. The application is not completed yet. Later we will have user management so instead of the Cashier1 the name of the cashier will stand there. For manager too (in Products and Categories tabs). 
The App can be optimized as well by using a design pattern. 
I would be happy to see your opinios about the app ;)
